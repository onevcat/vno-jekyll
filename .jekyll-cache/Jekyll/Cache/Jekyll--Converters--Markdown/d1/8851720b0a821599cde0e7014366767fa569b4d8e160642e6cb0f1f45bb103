<p>For better understand numbers, we need to represent the rational numbers at first.<br />
Imagine a number axis L, with a unit length 1, we can rule the positive direction and negative direction.<br />

And then we need to represent the rational numbers. Arbitrarily set a point ‘P’. Segment arbitrary unit, like +- 1, +-2 into smaller pieces, and one of the pieces is 1/p. As you can see in the Figure 2 below.<br />

In this way, we can find the every point rational point p/q, the P is on the p/q or between two rational point p/q and (p+1)/q. In the other word, we find any rational point p/q on this number axis L.<br />
We call this two quantities whose ratio is a rational number <strong>Commensurable Number</strong>. Because it can be expressed as integral multiples of a common unit. And there is <strong>Incommensurable Number</strong> too. But why?<br /></p>

<p>Imagine there is triangle with (1^2 + 1^2 = 2)<br />
