<h2 id="definition-of-the-vector-spaces">Definition of The Vector Spaces</h2>
<p><strong>Vector space</strong> is a very important concept, which is denoted by $R^1, R^2, R^3 ‚Ä¶ R^n$, which consists of a <em>a whole collection of vectors</em>. For example, $R^5$ contains all column vectors with five components, the so-called ‚Äúive-dimentional space‚Äù.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>DEFINITION</strong> The space $R^n$ consists of all column vectors v with n components.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are three vector spaces other than $R^n$:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>M</strong> The vector space of <strong><em>all real 2 by 2 matrices</em></strong> <br />
<strong>F</strong> <em>The vector space of <strong>*all real functions $f(x)$</strong></em> <br />
<strong>Z</strong> The vector sapce that consists only of a <strong><em>zero vector</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>PS</strong>*:The function space F is infinite-dimensional. A smaller function space is $P$, or $P_n$ containing all polynomials $a_0 + a_1x ‚Ä¶ a_nx^n$ of degree n.</p>
<h2 id="subspaces">Subspaces</h2>
<p>A plane in three-dimensional space is not $R^2$ (even if it looks like $R^2$). The vectors have three components and they belong to $R^3$. The plane is a vector space <strong><em>inside $R^3$</em></strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>DEFINITION</strong> A subspace of a vector space is a set of vectors (including 0) that satisfies two requirements: <strong><em>If $v$ and $w$ are vectors in the subspace and $c$ is any scalar, then<br /></em></strong>
( i ) $v+w$ is in the subspace <br />
( ii ) $cv$ is in the subspace</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two facts,</p>
<ol>
  <li>Every subspace contains the zero vector.</li>
  <li>Lines through the origin are also subspaces.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>( $L$ ) Any line through (0, 0, 0)<br />
( $P$ ) Any plane through (0, 0, 0)<br />
( $R^3$ ) The whole space<br />
( $Z$ ) The single vector (0, 0, 0)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-column-space-of-a">The Column Space of A</h2>
<p>Start with the columns of A and <strong><em>take all their linear combinations. This produces the column space of A, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">It is a vector space made up of column vectors</code></em></strong>. $C(A)$ contains not just the $n$ columns of $A$, but all their combinations $Ax$.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>DEFINITION The <strong><em>column space</em></strong> consists of <strong><em>all linear combinations of the columns</em></strong>. The combinations are all possible vectors $Ax$. They fill the column space $C(A)$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To solve $Ax = b$ is to express b as a combination of the columns.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>The system $Ax = b$ is solvable if and only if b is in the column space of $A$.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Instead of columns in $R^m$, we could start with any set $S$ of vectors in a vector space $V$. To get a subspace $SS$ of $V$, we take all combinations of the vectors in that set:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$S$ = set of vectors in V (probabley not a subspace)<br />
$SS$ = all combinations of vectors in $S$<br />
$SS$ = all $c_1v_1 + ‚Ä¶+ c_Nv_N$ = the subspace of $V$ ‚Äúspannd‚Äù by $S$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When $S$ is the set of columns, $SS$ is the column space. When there is noly one nonzero vector $v$ in $S$, the subspace $SS$ is the line through $v$. ALways $SS$ is the smallest subspace containing $S$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The subspace $SS$ is the ‚Äúspan‚Äù of $S$, containing all combinaitons of vectors in $S$.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="some-problems-to-learn">Some Problems to Learn</h2>
<p>In the definition of a vector space, vector spaces are not necessarily column vectors. In the definition of a vector space, vector addition $x+y$ and scalar multiplicaiton $cx$ must obey the following eight rules:</p>
<ol>
  <li>$x+y=y+x$</li>
  <li>$x+(y+z)=(x+y)+z$</li>
  <li>There is a unique ‚Äòzero vector‚Äô such that $x+0=x$ for all $x$</li>
  <li>For each $x$ there is a unique vector $-x$ such that $x + (-x) = 0$</li>
  <li>1 times $x$ equals $x$</li>
  <li>$(c_1c_2)x=c_1(c_2x)$</li>
  <li>$c(x+y)=cx + cy$</li>
  <li>$(c_1+c_2)x = c_1x + c_2x$</li>
</ol>

<p>For example:<br />
Problems, <br /></p>
<ol>
  <li>The possitive numbers with $x + y$ and $cx$ redefined to equal the usual $xy$ and $x^c$ do satisfy the eight rules. Test rule 7 when $c =3, x = 2, y =1$. (Then $x+y=2$ and $cx=8$.) Which number acts as the ‚Äúzero vector‚Äù?
    <blockquote>
      <p>$c(x+y)\to(xy)^c$, and zero vector is 1</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>$A$ = 
\(\begin{bmatrix}
 1 &amp; 0\\
 0 &amp; 0\\
 \end{bmatrix}\)
and $B$ = 
\(\begin{bmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0\\
 0 &amp; -1\\
 \end{bmatrix}\)
, if a subspace of M does contain $A$ and $B$, must it contain $I$?
    <blockquote>
      <p>From the DIFINITION of subspace, we can find when $u$ and $w$ are two vectors in the subspace. $u + w$ is also in the subspace is also in the subspace. Because that $A - B$ = 
\(\begin{bmatrix}
 1 &amp; 0\\
 0 &amp; 1\\
 \end{bmatrix}\)
= $I$, this subspace must contain $I$.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>The subspaces of $R^3$ are planes, lines , $R^3$ itself, or $Z$ containing only (0, 0 ,0).</li>
  <li>Show that the set of singular matrices in $M$ is not a subspace.
    <blockquote>
      <p>Import two singular matrices, $A$ =
\(\begin{bmatrix}
 1&amp;0\\
 0&amp;0\\
 \end{bmatrix}\)
, and $B$ = 
\(\begin{bmatrix}
 0&amp;0\\
 0&amp;1\\
 \end{bmatrix}\)
. It‚Äôs because that the sum of $A,B$ is 
\(\begin{bmatrix}
 1&amp;0\\
 0&amp;1\\
 \end{bmatrix}\)
which is invertible, so the set of singular matrices in $M$ is not a subspace.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>The columns of $AB$ are combinations of the columns of $A$. This means: The column space of $AB$ is contained in (possibly equal to) the column space of A. Give an example where the column spaces of $A$ and $AB$ are not equal.
    <blockquote>
      <p>If $B$ is a zero matrix, while $A!=0$, then $AB$ is smaller than $A$ and not equal to each other.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>If $A$ is any n by n invertible matrix, then its column space is $R^n$, WHY?
    <blockquote>
      <p>$Ax = b$ is always solved by $x = A^{-1}b$</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
