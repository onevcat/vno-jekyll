<p><strong>Vector space</strong> is a very important concept, which is denoted by $R^1, R^2, R^3 … R^n$, which consists of a <em>a whole collection of vectors</em>. For example, $R^5$ contains all column vectors with five components, the so-called “ive-dimentional space”.</p>

  <p><strong>DEFINITION</strong> The space $R^n$ consists of all column vectors v with n components.</p>
