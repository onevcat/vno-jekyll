## I have decided!

I have decided to restart my Calculus learning. Reference book is 'Introduction to Calculus and Analysis' by Richard Courant and Fritz John. <br>

## 1 Introduction 
### How to represent rational numbers
For better comprehension of numbers, we need to represent the rational numbers at first.<br>
Imagine a number axis L, with a unit length 1, we can rule the positive direction and negative direction.<br>

And then we need to represent the rational numbers. Arbitrarily set a point 'P', and then we rule the distance from 0 to P is |P|. Segment |P| into q pieces. As you can see in the Figure 2 below.<br>

In this way, we can find p point p/q, and ||P|-p/q)| < 1/q. In the other word, we find any rational point p/q on this number axis L.<br>
We call this two quantities whose ratio is a rational number **Commensurable Number**. Because it can be expressed as integral multiples. And there is **Incommensurable Number** too. But why?<br>
Imagine there is triangle with (1^2 + 1^2 = 2)<br>
