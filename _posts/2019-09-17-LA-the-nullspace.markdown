### The Nullspace of A
> The nullspace $N(A)$ consists of all solutions to $Ax=0$. These vectors $x$ are in $R^n$.

The solution vectors $x$ have $n$ components. They are vectors in $R^n$, so the *nullspace is a subspace of $R^n$*. The $C(A)$ is a subspace of $R^m$.
The $N(A)$ contains all the combinations of the ***special solutions*** to $Ax=0$.

**Example** $x+2y+3z=0$ comes from the 1 by 3 matrix $A$ = $\begin{bmatrix}1&2&3\\\end{bmatrix}$.
