What will happen, when we multiply an elimination matrix from the other side?<br>
You can see the process below,

Multiplying by E21 on the right side will subtract 4 times column 2 from column 1. (4 times row 2 from 1 on the left side)<br>
It is the same with Row Exchange Matrix (Permutation matrix)
