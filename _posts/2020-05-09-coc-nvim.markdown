Here I will do some reading notes about the `neoclide/coc.nvim`. And the main reference is from the [coc.txt](https://github.com/zququ/coc.nvim/blob/master/doc/coc.txt).

## coc-Introduction

Here is the coc-introduction

Coc.nvim enhances your (Neo)Vim to match the user experience provided by VSCode
through rich plugin ecosystem and Language Server Protocol support.

It's designed to have a good integration with other Vim plugins as much as
possible.

Coc.nvim is configurable and you can control the features that you want
through the options for the best experience.
