# Vno - Jekyll

[Vno Jekyll](https://github.com/onevcat/vno-jekyll) is a theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). It is a port of my Ghost theme [vno](https://github.com/onevcat/vno), which is originally developed from [Dale Anthony's Uno](https://github.com/daleanthony/uno).

## Live Demo

See [Vno - Jekyll](http://vno.onevcat.com) site and [my blog](http://onevcat.com).

You can also find some instruction as well as other sites using Vno theme in [this page](http://vno.onevcat.com/2016/02/hello-world-vno/).
